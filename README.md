# CS-272 - Lab 1

- Compiles with Java 11 on eclipse.
- Place I/O files in "root" folder (uppermost in eclipse)


## Important notes

### 1
I edited the data file to have a seperate Firstname and Lastname column.
I did this because all the values were separated by commas incuding the
first and last name so this was the most practical fix I could think of in the alloted time.


### 2
When I first started the Lab I thought "copy running output to file" meant to programatically write the results of the code to the file. 
e.g for the addition to output the answer of the addition to the file. 
Near the deadline I was informed that this actually just meant to run them and paste the output manually to the file.
So that's what I did.
